## Description

In November 2022, the microblogging service Twitter (now [X](https://x.com)) was acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, triggering the first of several exoduses of its users.
Amongst those who left the site for other services, or who simply stopped using it, were archaeologists and other scientists.
'Science Twitter' was an established venue for scholarly communication on social media, providing a platform for researchers to talk directly to each other and to the public [@CheplyginaEtAl2020].
Its sudden disintegration was a wake-up call, highlighting the risks of entrusting public scientific discourse to a single private corporation.
Recent controversial decisions by the corporate owners of other social media platforms like Slack and Reddit, for example, have also affected academic users, leading to similar departures.

Amongst several alternatives, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) emerged as the primary destination for scholars leaving Twitter [@Insall2023].
Mastodon is very similar to Twitter in its design and function, but rather than being controlled by a single corporation, it is a decentralised network of individual servers based on free and open source software.
Servers 'federate' with each other using an open, W3C-standardised protocol (ActivityPub), allowing communication across Mastodon instances and a wider 'Fediverse' of interoperable services, e.g. photo-sharing software [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), or instant messaging service [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).
The Fediverse presents a golden opportunity for scholars to reclaim ownership over the infrastructure that supports their participation on social media, and other aspects of their online experiences, too [@BrembsEtAl2023].

We created [archaeo.social](https://archaeo.social) in November 2022 to encourage the use of federated social media for scholarly communication in archaeology. It has X active users and an average of Y posts per day, and Z individuals who identify as archaeologists are registered across the Fediverse, as of August 2023 [@ShilobodEtAl2023].
The aim of this panel is to critically examine this emerging community and the role of the Fediverse in the future of scholarly communication.
We invite discussion of the use and potential of decentralised social media for archaeology; of risks, challenges, and critiques; and reflections on the future trajectory of archaeo.social and archaeology in the Fediverse more broadly.
